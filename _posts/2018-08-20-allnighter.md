Last friday was one of those days when, reality hits ..! So, I visited my website www.allnighter.in and it wasn't working. There was this big error.. I paid for it you know and so I felt bad ...

Me, the chepskate ... I've hosted my unknown blog before on github.. and so, it occured to me, that finally it might be worth something .. !

So, here I go .. ! Setting up things !

#### Step 1

![Create Repository !!](/assets/images/2018-08-20-allnighter/pic1.png)



#### Step 2

##### Setting up local system

1. [github doc](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/)
2. [jekyll doc](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)



#### Step 3 : Hunt down free theme !!

**Suggestion : **

>	If you want to do all by your self then please go on read the jekyll doc ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯
	If your are into that sort of thing..!

Here is the result of googling - ["free jekyll themes"](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=free+jekyll+themes&rlz=1C5CHFA_enIN764IN764&oq=free+jekyll&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i60j69i61j69i57j0l2.3375j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

I got [**FORTY**](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/forty-jekyll-theme)

>**PS :** Don't waste too much time just pick this one.. .! It is hard to edit cause there are dozen things to edit but hell with them !



#### Step 4 : Lets do the fun work .. shall, we ?! ðŸ¤˜

[Forty Source Code](https://github.com/andrewbanchich/forty-jekyll-theme)

1. Clone this reposity. (_I believe you can do this by your self_ ðŸ˜‡)

2. `cd cloned_repo`

3. `rm -rf .git`

4. The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is only needed for GitLab Pages, so delete it if you are using GitHub instead. _Which we are .. in case you haven't noticed !_

5. Start editing the `_config.yml` file!

   Ohh .. you want example is it..!! okay .. ðŸ¤¨

   [`_config.yml` for allnighter.in](https://github.com/pskanade/pskanade.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml)

   Which brings us one step closer ... If everything goes accordingly. ðŸ˜…


#### Step 5

[Creating a local project](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)

Copying the git repository address -

![Here, You can get the URL](/assets/images/2018-08-20-allnighter/pic3.png)



Now we have an initial project ... !! don't we ! ðŸ¤“



#### Step 6

Goto, the `URL` .. ðŸ¤© ... What .. you want me to help you with that too .. smugs !! ðŸ¤¬
