# Pranav Kanade

## At a glance

- In morning, I am a software engineer at **Persistent Systems**.
- But at night I am a **Pythonista** , who is in pursuit of building the **AI programmer**.
- You will always find me experimenting with some new technology. Currently **Blockchain** has my attention.

## Initiatives

1. **[Sunday-Projects](https://github.com/pskanade/sunday-projects)**:
  - **Aim:** To experiment with new technologies.
  - It gives me an opportunity to learn how some of the new technology works. It helps in identifying the use cases where a particular tech will be useful.
2. Load-star:
  - This was a group that I'd started during my second year of college.
  - I started this with an aim to help students to address their problems.

## Courses and Certifications

1. **Deep Learning Specialist (Coursera)**:
  - **[Deeplearning_specialization](https://github.com/pskanade/Deeplearning_specialization)** : Repository of all the assignments completed in regards to completion of Deep learning specialization.
2. **Python for Data Science (IBM)**:
  - A badge that I completed in showcasing my knowledge of the language.
3. **Using Python to Access Web Data (Coursera)**:
  - **[python_to_access_web_data](https://github.com/pskanade/python_to_access_web_data)** : Repository of all the assignments completed in regards to completion of the course.

## Independent Projects

0. **[Fundme - with ethereum](https://github.com/pskanade/fundMe-With-Ethereum)** : (Working on it)
  > AIM : Build a clone of kickstarter, which makes it difficult for scammers to take advantage of the platform.
  - Used **Ethereum** and **Solidity** to implement the contract.
  - Implemented contract - [link](https://github.com/pskanade/fundMe-With-Ethereum/blob/master/contracts/src/Campaign.sol)
0. **[stretch](https://github.com/pskanade/stretch)** :
  > AIM : With this I am trying to build an **AI programmer**.
  - My one of the most ambitious long term project.
  - This is work in progress, I've collected the dataset of python challenges from HackerRank.
0. **[Engine](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xx47F7LHWmTFWdr02P0p4RaAAIR-18HG1jMigHAoAA0/edit?usp=sharing)** : (July, 16 - May, 17)
 > AIM : Automatic text categorization and solving mathematical word problems.
  - We were able to build a system which was able to solve algebric word problems autonomously.
  - Project was fully funded by Persistent Systems Ltd. Pune.
  - PS: open slide deck in presentation mode :)
0. **Reimplementation of pix2code** : (Working on it)
  > AIM : Replicate the original results
  - Based on research paper from april 2017.
  - It uses, CNN (for Image captioning) and LSTM (for sampling the code sequence being generated)
0. **[ICPC_repo](https://github.com/pskanade/ICPC_repo)** :
  > AIM: Get selected for ACM ICPC onsite round
  - So, I wrote aprox 6000 lines of code over two months.
  - A repository of implementation of popular Algorithms and Data structures.
