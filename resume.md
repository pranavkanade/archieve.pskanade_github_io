# Pranav Kanade
##### <a href="{{ site.github_url }}" class="icon alt fa-github" target="_blank"><span class="label">GitHub</span></a>

#### At a glance

- In morning, I am a software engineer at **Persistent Systems**.
- But at night I am a **fullstack hobbyist**, who is in pursuit of building great looking products.
- You will always find me experimenting with some new technology. Currently **Kubernetes** has my attention.

#### Initiatives

1. **[Sunday-Projects](https://github.com/pskanade/sunday-projects)**:
  <br/>**AIM :** _To experiment with new technologies._
  - Most sundays, I work on something new and try to build end to end prototype.
  - It gives me an opportunity to learn how some of the new technology works.
  - It helps in identifying the use cases where a particular technology will be useful.
2. **Load-star**:
  <br/>**AIM :** _To help students with programming._
  - Started this when I was in second year of my degree program.

#### Independent Projects

0. **[fake_twitter](https://github.com/pskanade/fake_twitter)** :
  <br/>**AIM :** _Build a clone of twitter's backend._
  - Used **Python** and **Django** to implement the requirement.
0. **[Fund me - with ethereum](https://github.com/pskanade/fundMe-With-Ethereum)** :
  <br/>**AIM :** _Build a clone of kickstarter, which makes it difficult for scammers to take advantage of the platform._
  - Used **Ethereum** and **Solidity** to implement the contract.
  - Implemented contract - [link](https://github.com/pskanade/fundMe-With-Ethereum/blob/master/contracts/src/Campaign.sol)
0. **[stretch](https://github.com/pskanade/stretch)** :
  <br/>**AIM :** _With this I am trying to build an **AI programmer**._
  - My one of the most ambitious long term project.
  - This is work in progress, I've collected the dataset of python challenges from HackerRank.
0. **[Engine](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xx47F7LHWmTFWdr02P0p4RaAAIR-18HG1jMigHAoAA0/edit?usp=sharing)** : (July, 16 - May, 17)
 <br/>**AIM :** _Automatic text categorization and solving mathematical word problems._
  - We were able to build a system which was able to solve algebraic word problems autonomously.
  - Project was fully funded by Persistent Systems Ltd. Pune.
  - PS: open slide deck in presentation mode :)
0. **Reimplementation of pix2code** : (Working on it)
  <br/>**AIM :** _Replicate the original results_
  - Based on research paper from april 2017.
  - It uses, CNN (for Image captioning) and LSTM (for sampling the code sequence being generated)
0. **[ICPC_repo](https://github.com/pskanade/ICPC_repo)** :
  <br/>AIM: _Get selected for ACM ICPC onsite round_
  - So, I wrote approx 6000 lines of code over two months.
  - A repository of implementation of popular Algorithms and Data structures.

#### Hackathon Projects
